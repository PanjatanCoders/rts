## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Not receiving emails

**Check:**
1. ‚úÖ Email verification link was clicked
2. ‚úÖ Check spam/junk folder
3. ‚úÖ Access key is correctly copied in script.js
4. ‚úÖ No typos in YOUR_EMAIL constant

### Issue: Form submits but goes to WhatsApp instead

**Reason:** Access key not configured correctly

**Solution:**
- Make sure you replaced `'YOUR_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY'` with your actual key
- Remove the quotes around the key if you accidentally added extra ones
- Key should be in single quotes: `'abcd1234-...'`

### Issue: Want to test if Web3Forms is working

**Open browser console** (F12) and check for:
- ‚úÖ `‚úÖ Callback request sent successfully via Web3Forms` = Working!
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `‚ö†Ô∏è Web3Forms not configured. Using WhatsApp fallback.` = Not configured yet
- ‚ùå `Web3Forms error:` = Check your access key

### Scenario 1: Web3Forms Configured ‚úÖ
1. User fills callback form
2. Form submits to Web3Forms API
3. You receive email notification
4. User sees success message
5. WhatsApp is NOT opened

### Scenario 2: Web3Forms Not Configured ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. User fills callback form
2. Code detects no access key
3. Automatically falls back to WhatsApp
4. WhatsApp opens with pre-filled message
5. User sends message via WhatsApp

### Scenario 3: Web3Forms Error (Network/API issue) üîÑ
1. User fills callback form
2. Web3Forms API call fails
3. Automatically falls back to WhatsApp
4. No data is lost!

## Current Configuration

Your callback form is currently set up with:

1. **Primary Method**: Web3Forms (when you add your access key)
   - Sends to: `razatechnologyservices@gmail.com`

2. **Fallback Method**: WhatsApp (already working)
   - Number: `+91 70304 00093`

**Best of both worlds!** You get professional email notifications, but if anything goes wrong, WhatsApp takes over automatically.
